Heating or cooling degree days roughly correlate with building heating or cooling needs, providing a simple useful estimate in energy planning. Heating degree days (HDD) measure how cold the temperature was on a given day or period of days, which shapes the need for a certain amount of building heating. For example, a day with an average temperature of 40°F has 25 HDD (65 – 40 = 25 HDD), whereas a day with an average temperature of 55°F only has 10 HDD. Similarly, cooling degree days (CDD) measure how hot the temperature was on a given day. A day with an average temperature of 90°F has 25 CDD (90 – 65 = 25 CDD) and needs significantly more cooling than a day with an average temperature of 70°F (5 CDD). Degree days in ClimRR are calculated on both annual and seasonal timesteps (total HDD/CDD for period) and are the average for a given scenario, calculated as an ensemble mean.

ClimRR_Summer_Heat_Index_Group_Layer,FeatureServer,https://services.arcgis.com/XG15cJAlne2vxtgt/ArcGIS/rest/services/ClimRR_Summer_Heat_Index_Group_Layer/FeatureServer,"Heat index uses both temperature and relative humidity to provide a better picture of how hot the outside weather feels to humans. The heat index information provided in ClimRR is calculated using an extended heat index formula that better captures extreme heat conditions. Using this heat index method is important for understanding how climate change will produce extremes beyond those typically experienced under historical conditions. Since heat index is a measure whose utility primarily applies to hot conditions, rather than cold conditions, all heat index attributes currently in ClimRR are based on summer measurements (June, July, August). We used the daily maximum heat index readings to calculate several different measures of historical and future heat. We provide daily maximum estimates that are the average of every day’s maximum heat index for the summer months (i.e., about 90 readings per summer). We also provide the seasonal maximum estimate, which is the single highest maximum heat index reading for a given summer (i.e., the highest daily maximum heat index for 2045), averaged across the decade. Finally, we use the daily maximum heat index values to calculate the average number of summer days in which the heat index exceeds a given threshold value. We use four thresholds: 95°F, 105°F, 115°F, and 125°F. These thresholds represent a range of relative heat-related danger to humans. Change layers help to visualize the amount of growth in high heat days at mid- and end-century. For more information on the heat index data in ClimRR, please see the ClimRR Data page."

SocialVulnerabilityIndex2016,FeatureServer,https://services.arcgis.com/XG15cJAlne2vxtgt/ArcGIS/rest/services/SocialVulnerabilityIndex2016/FeatureServer,"ATSDR’s Geospatial Research, Analysis & Services Program (GRASP) created the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to help public health officials and emergency response planners identify and map the communities that will most likely need support before, during, and after a hazardous event. 
CDC’s SVI indicates the relative vulnerability of every U.S. Census tract. Census tracts are subdivisions of counties for which the Census collects statistical data. The SVI ranks the tracts on 15 social factors, including unemployment, minority status, and disability, and further groups them into four related themes. Thus each tract receives a ranking for each Census variable and for each of the four themes, as well as an overall ranking.
