Heating or cooling degree days roughly correlate with building heating or cooling needs, providing a simple useful estimate in energy planning. Heating degree days (HDD) measure how cold the temperature was on a given day or period of days, which shapes the need for a certain amount of building heating. For example, a day with an average temperature of 40°F has 25 HDD (65 – 40 = 25 HDD), whereas a day with an average temperature of 55°F only has 10 HDD. Similarly, cooling degree days (CDD) measure how hot the temperature was on a given day. A day with an average temperature of 90°F has 25 CDD (90 – 65 = 25 CDD) and needs significantly more cooling than a day with an average temperature of 70°F (5 CDD).

The heat index information provided in ClimRR is calculated using an extended heat index formula that better captures extreme heat conditions. Using this heat index method is important for understanding how climate change will produce extremes beyond those typically experienced under historical conditions. Since heat index is a measure whose utility primarily applies to hot conditions, rather than cold conditions, all heat index attributes currently in ClimRR are based on summer measurements (June, July, August). We used the daily maximum heat index readings to calculate several different measures of historical and future heat. We provide daily maximum estimates that are the average of every day’s maximum heat index for the summer months (i.e., about 90 readings per summer). We also provide the seasonal maximum estimate, which is the single highest maximum heat index reading for a given summer (i.e., the highest daily maximum heat index for 2045), averaged across the decade. Finally, we use the daily maximum heat index values to calculate the average number of summer days in which the heat index exceeds a given threshold value. We use four thresholds: 95°F, 105°F, 115°F, and 125°F. These thresholds represent a range of relative heat-related danger to humans. Change layers help to visualize the amount of growth in high heat days at mid- and end-century. For more information on the heat index data in ClimRR, please see the ClimRR Data page.",TRUE

Temperature is a measure of hotness or coldness on a given scale, usually Fahrenheit or Celsius (we use Fahrenheit on ClimRR). Average temperatures – over months, seasons, or years – provide a broad picture of how hot or cold a place is and its general habitability. Average temperatures also allow an evaluation of changes over long periods of time (e.g., decades), including projected changes in the future. The layers in this map explorer depict historical and projected future temperature maximums. ‘Maximum’ refers to the highest of the 8 daily temperature readings generated in ClimRR’s climate modeling. We present seasonal and annual averages of daily maximum temperatures. Note that the maximum temperatures here are averages based on each day’s high temperature over a season or year. They are not the highest temperature recorded for that season or year. Many days, and even extended periods, will exceed these average maxima.

Argonne’s climate modeling generates 8 wind speed readings per day, which represent the average wind speed over a 3-hour period.

The PAD-US geodatabase was originally developed to organize and assess the management status (i.e. apply 'GAP Status Code') of elements of biodiversity protection by identifying species and plant communities not adequately represented in existing conservation lands. In cooperation with the United Nations Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC), PAD-US also supports global conservation analyses to inform policy decisions. The dataset is robust and has been expanded in recent years to support the recreation, natural resource management, wildfire, emergency management, transportation, research, and public health communities. New applications are frequently discovered. Multiple attributes and a flexible database structure provide context for data to be used at local (depending on inventory completeness in the local area), regional, State, national, and international scales.

The HSI quantifies the decreased stability of housing due to missed or deferred housing payments (rent or mortgage payments) due to COVID-19 impacts, such as loss of employment. A county with an HSI of 1.0 indicates that the risk of housing disruptions in the county has not increased due to COVID-19 impacts relative to the baseline risk of housing disruptions. Furthermore, a county with an HSI of 0.96 indicates that approximately 4% fewer households in that county are stable due to missed rent or mortgage payments than in January 2020.

The service area is the geographic area within which a 911 call placed using a landline is answered at the associated PSAP. This dataset only includes primary PSAPs. Secondary PSAPs, backup PSAPs, and wireless PSAPs have been excluded from this dataset. Primary PSAPs receive calls directly, whereas secondary PSAPs receive calls that have been transferred by a primary PSAP. Backup PSAPs provide service in cases where another PSAP is inoperable. Most military bases have their own emergency telephone systems. To connect to such a system from within a military base, it may be necessary to dial a number other than 9 1 1. Due to the sensitive nature of military installations, TGS did not actively research these systems. If civilian authorities in surrounding areas volunteered information about these systems, or if adding a military PSAP was necessary to fill a hole in civilian provided data, TGS included it in this dataset. Otherwise, military installations are depicted as being covered by one or more adjoining civilian emergency telephone systems. In some cases, areas are covered by more than one PSAP boundary. In these cases, any of the applicable PSAPs may take a 911 call. Where a specific call is routed may depend on how busy the applicable PSAPs are (i.e., load balancing), operational status (i.e., redundancy), or time of day / day of week. If an area does not have 911 service, TGS included that area in the dataset along with the address and phone number of their dispatch center. These are areas where someone must dial a 7 or 10 digit number to get emergency services. These records can be identified by a ""Y"" in the [NON911EMNO] field. This indicates that dialing 911 inside one of these areas does not connect one with emergency services. This dataset was constructed by gat",FALSE

Other sites are unofficial and sites not on the list can be selected if conditions warrant. 
In 2015, the NWS began conveying the approximate lateral extent of areas at risk for life-threatening storm surge in its text products using fixed 'communication points', similar to the breakpoints used to convey the tropical cyclone watches and warnings.

CDC’s SVI indicates the relative vulnerability of every U.S. Census tract. Census tracts are subdivisions of counties for which the Census collects statistical data. The SVI ranks the tracts on 15 social factors, including unemployment, minority status, and disability, and further groups them into four related themes. Thus each tract receives a ranking for each Census variable and for each of the four themes, as well as an overall ranking.
