# The following code is an example of reading the pipe-delimited Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) 
# 	data into an R dataframe in preparation for analysis. Specifically, this code loads in both the primary data file 
#   and the calendar-year replicate weights file (as opposed to the longitudinal replicate weights). These files are 
#   separate downloads on the SIPP website.
# SIPP data are in person-month format, meaning each record represents one month for a specific person.
#   Unique persons are identified using SSUID+PNUM. Unique households are identified using SSUID+ERESIDENCEID. For 
#   additional guidance on using SIPP data, please see the SIPP Users' Guide at <https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/guidance/users-guide.html>
# This code was written in R 4.1.0, and requires the "data.table", "dplyer", and "bit64" packages. 
# Note the 'select' statement in the first use of fread(). Most machines do not have enough memory to read
# 	the entire SIPP file into memory. Use a 'select' statement to read in only the columns you are interested in using. 
#   If you still encounter an out-of-memory error, you must select less columns or less observations.
# Run this code from the same directory as the data.
# This code was written by Adam Smith. Please contact census.sipp@census.gov if you have any questions.
